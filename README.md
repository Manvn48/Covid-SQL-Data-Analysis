# Covid-SQL-Data-Analysis

In this project we explore global COVID 19 data in SQL.

## Setup

To begin exploring COVID data using SQL queries, you'll need:

- **Access to a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MS SQL Server, MySQL or SQLite:** Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed and configured on your machine. You can choose from popular options, depending on your preference and requirements.

- **COVID datasets imported into your SQL database in a format suitable for querying:** Obtain COVID datasets from reliable sources and import them into your SQL database. You can also use the dataset we have used present in this repo.

- **Clone or download this repository to your local machine:** Clone or download the GitHub repository containing the SQL COVID Data Exploration Project to your local machine. This repository contains SQL scripts, queries, and other resources to help you explore and analyze COVID data using SQL.



### Analysis

The analysis of COVID data using SQL queries may include:

- **Tracking daily new cases, deaths, and recoveries:** SQL queries can be used to aggregate and analyze daily COVID data to track the progression of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.

- **Examining regional and global trends in COVID spread:** By querying geographical data, SQL can help identify hotspots, trends, and patterns in COVID spread at regional and global levels. This analysis can aid in understanding the geographical dynamics of the pandemic.

- **Analyzing the impact of interventions such as lockdowns and vaccinations:** SQL queries can be used to assess the effectiveness of various interventions such as lockdown measures, social distancing policies, and vaccination campaigns. By correlating intervention data with COVID statistics, insights can be gained into their impact on controlling the spread of the virus.

- **Identifying demographic factors influencing COVID transmission and outcomes:** SQL queries can be employed to analyze demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions to identify factors influencing COVID transmission rates and outcomes.
  
- **Comparing COVID statistics across different countries or regions:** SQL queries can facilitate cross-country or cross-regional comparisons of COVID statistics such as infection rates, mortality rates, testing rates, and vaccination rates.
